# Project Description:
Amidst the pandemic, we proposed a solution to not let this multiply itself rapidly. We have two applications involved here. First is a "Chat Bot". As soon as we install this app, there will be a user registration following the input of details like age and symptoms by speech to text method. After which the user will be told about the suspect percentage of Corona Virus using ML kit which uses the database. If suspect percentage is alarming, we will quarantine the suspect and provide him with a wrist band having GSM which will be driven by another application. That band will measure the pulse rate and will keep the record of quarantine location of that person. If he removes the band the pulse rate would be zero and hence we know his unwillingness to cooperate, after which a notification will go to the concerned authority nearby using firebase cloud messaging. This solution is expected to reduce the increase in this virus spread.

# Challenges we ran into
- It was quite difficulty to integrate the band with the android device for location purpose and its activity with the gsm module.
- collection of a trusted Dataset for newly epidemic disease.
